Tex2Notebook is a Python script that converts LaTeX files (.tex) to Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb). It provides an easy and efficient way to convert LaTeX files into Jupyter Notebook format, which is widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.

You can customize the input and output file paths to match your own file names and locations. Note that this script assumes that the LaTeX file is well-formed and can be successfully converted to a Jupyter Notebook.

How to use Tex2Notebook: 
1. Install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:

```

pip install reuirements.txt
``` 
2. Download or clone the Tex2Notebook repository to your local machine. 
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the location of the Tex2Notebook script. 
4. Run the following command to convert your LaTeX file to Jupyter Notebook format:

```lua

python tex2notebook.py input.tex output.ipynb
```



Replace `input.tex` with the name of your LaTeX file and `output.ipynb` with the desired name for your Jupyter Notebook file. 
5. Your converted Jupyter Notebook file is ready to use!

Tex2Notebook makes it easy to share your LaTeX work with others in the scientific community who may not be familiar with LaTeX. It also allows you to take advantage of the features of Jupyter Notebook, such as inline code execution and interactive visualizations.

Give Tex2Notebook a try and see how it can help you streamline your workflow and make your research more accessible to others.
